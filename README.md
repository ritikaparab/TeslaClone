# TeslaClone
Clone Project! Made a Tesla Clone Website Using HTML CSS and JavaScript. As we know, aspiring Front-End Devs and students tend to make clone websites of a popular brands, so I made one. Chose Tesla because its design is sweetly simple and attractive. Cant buy a Tesla but definitely can code it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ
